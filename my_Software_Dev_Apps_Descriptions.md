End‑to‑end flow
---------------
1. User query arrives (web UI or CLI).  
2. Query router (LLM‑based classifier) decides:  
   • *Small‑talk* ➜ DialoGPT, return response.  
   • *Novel question* ➜ continue.  
3. Embed the query ➜ vector search in ChromaDB.  
4. Top‑k passages + original query ➜ Falcon‑7B‑Instruct using an RAG prompt template.  
5. Answer streamed back to the client, with cited excerpts.

Why these choices stand out
---------------------------
* **All‑local stack** – Chroma and open‑weight models mean the entire pipeline can run offline or on air‑gapped servers—handy for classroom or enterprise demos.  
* **Modular scripts (`app_v1` … `v6`)** – show an evolutionary path from quick prototype to more structured service; newcomers can pick the version matching their needs.  
* **Security baked in** – `git‑secrets` plus environment‑variable loading protect Hugging Face or OpenAI keys if the project later upgrades to hosted LLMs.  
* **Literary‑aware retrieval** – by storing each novel as its own document collection, the ANN search returns passages from the correct book even when titles aren’t supplied explicitly.

In one sentence
---------------
The project is a compact, security‑conscious RAG pipeline that marries **ChromaDB’s lightning‑fast vector search** with **open‑source LLMs (Falcon‑7B & DialoGPT)**, orchestrated by **LangChain** and served through **Flask**, to let readers interrogate entire novels as easily as chatting with a friend.




# my App 2: RealEstateProject

Truffle Suite as the dev pipeline
---------------------------------
Compilation → migration → testing happens with a single CLI  
(`truffle compile`, `truffle migrate`, `truffle test`).  
That tight feedback loop makes iterating on three token standards practical.

Artifacts‑first workflow
------------------------
The front‑end doesn’t hard‑code byte‑code; it simply imports whatever Truffle
spits out in `build/contracts`.  
If you swap Solidity versions, the UI remains unchanged—just re‑build and redeploy.

On‑chain unit tests
-------------------
The `test/` directory gives you deterministic, fork‑free regression tests using
Ganache’s in‑memory blockchain.  
That’s how you can prove batch‑reward logic (ERC‑1155) really saves gas before
you pay real ETH.

Optional hybrid architecture
----------------------------
The presence of a `backend/` folder shows you can pair the trustless layer with
traditional Web2 services (KYC, search indexing, e‑mail) while still keeping
critical state on‑chain.

One‑command local stack
-----------------------
With Truffle + Ganache CLI you can spin up a dev network, deploy contracts,
run tests, and launch the React SPA—all without Internet.  
That makes the project classroom‑friendly and CI‑friendly.


Bottom line
-----------
* **Truffle & Mocha** power a reproducible Solidity workflow.  
* **React‑Bootstrap + Web3.js** deliver a slick, wallet‑native UI.  
* **ERC‑20 / ERC‑721 / ERC‑1155** contracts demonstrate three asset types in one cohesive product.  

Together they form a full‑stack, open‑source blueprint for on‑chain real‑estate
transactions—right down to automated deployment and test coverage.
