Recommendation System: A/B Test System Design (Business Scope)
Feb 2024 - Feb 2024Feb 2024 - Feb 2024
1. Metrics: Primary, Secondary, and Guardrails
‚Ä¢ Primary metric is the single main outcome used to judge success. It must be attributable, sensitive, and stable.
‚Ä¢ Examples: daily engagement rate per user, average time spent, 7-day retention.
‚Ä¢ Secondary metrics support understanding, explain why results changed, or uncover side effects.
‚Ä¢ Examples: share rate, cold-start content views, creator diversity.
‚Ä¢ Guardrail metrics protect user experience, system performance, and business health.
‚Ä¢ Examples: latency (p95/p99), crash rate, content quality, policy violations, ad revenue.
‚Ä¢ Rule: Primary decides go/no-go; guardrails ensure we don‚Äôt ‚Äúwin dirty.‚Äù

2. Power & Sample Size
‚Ä¢ Use historical data to estimate baseline metrics and plug into a calculator or internal tooling.
‚Ä¢ Apply techniques to reduce sample size:
‚Ä¢ Trigger-based sampling: include only exposed/affected users
‚Ä¢ Variance reduction (e.g. CUPED): use pre-experiment behavior as a covariate
‚Ä¢ Adjust for clustering: feeds aren‚Äôt IID, so real sample needs may be higher (see next)

4. Feed-Specific Statistical Considerations
‚Ä¢ Feeds violate the IID assumption ‚Äî user and content exposures are highly correlated.

Design strategies:
‚Ä¢ Use user-level randomization to avoid users seeing both treatment and control
‚Ä¢ Trigger-based: only count users who open the feed
‚Ä¢ Use switchback experiments when testing infrastructure (alternate by time slot or geography)

Analysis strategies:
‚Ä¢ Aggregate metrics at the user-day level
‚Ä¢ Use cluster-robust standard errors to account for within-user correlations
‚Ä¢ Pre-bucket users to stabilize variance across experiments
‚Ä¢ Use inverse propensity weighting or position correction if needed at impression level

Leakage control:
‚Ä¢ Avoid splitting viral content or creators across groups
‚Ä¢ For highly interconnected systems, consider ghost experiments (logging-only) or community-level randomization

1. Trustworthiness: SRM, Stopping Rules, Multiplicity
‚Ä¢ SRM (Sample Ratio Mismatch): check that control/treatment ratios match expectations.
‚Ä¢ Use chi-square test; if mismatched, pause and investigate routing or triggering logic.

Stopping rules: pre-register window and analysis plan.
‚Ä¢ Don‚Äôt peek and stop early without correction ‚Äî it increases false positive risk.
‚Ä¢ Use alpha-spending or Bayesian approaches for valid early stopping.

Multiple comparisons:
‚Ä¢ Stick to one primary metric
‚Ä¢ For secondary metrics or multiple variants, apply FDR correction (e.g. Benjamini-Hochberg)
‚Ä¢ When running multiple variants, bandits are useful, but final rollout should be confirmed with traditional testing

2. Practical Execution Plan
‚Ä¢ 1. Define goal and thresholds
‚Äì ‚ÄúWe aim for a +1% lift in daily engagement.‚Äù
‚Äì MDE = +1%, alpha = 0.05, power = 0.8

‚Ä¢ 2. Estimate sample size
‚Äì Use historical data and tools to calculate triggered users per group

‚Ä¢ 3. Randomization
‚Äì User-level bucketing
‚Äì Include only triggered users (e.g. those opening the feed)
‚Äì Avoid creator/content leakage across groups

‚Ä¢ 4. Variance reduction
‚Äì Use historical behavior (e.g. previous 7-day averages) as covariates

‚Ä¢ 5. Metric computation and significance
‚Äì Aggregate at user-day level
‚Äì Use cluster-robust t-tests or regression

‚Ä¢ 6. Health checks
‚Äì Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM)
‚Äì Latency, crash rate
‚Äì Guardrail metrics (e.g. harmful content, user complaints)

‚Ä¢ 7. Interpretation and rollout
‚Äì Check if primary passed, and guardrails held
‚Äì Analyze heterogeneity (e.g. new vs. existing users)
‚Äì Decide: roll out, iterate, or rollback
‚Äì Optionally run follow-up experiment to confirm long-term effects (e.g. 28-day retention)

# Open Source Contributions

## Recommendation Systems
- Spotify/Pedalboard: Fixed #411. [Method] Added 20-line PortAudio guard that raises RunTime Error when an output device vanishes, [Issue] eliminating an infinite-block bug that could [Impact] stall Spotify‚Äôs Safe-and-Sound pipelines (used to vet 7 M+ podcasts for 696 M MAU)

- Meta-RecSys/Generative-Recommenders: Fixed #308. [Method] Added a gin-configurable HSTU attention backend dispatcher (auto‚ÜíC++ on Hopper, else logs safe fallback) without changing defaults. [Issue] Addresses the H100 efficiency / missing integration called out. [Impact] Hopper gets the optimized attention path without public-pipeline changes; HSTU underpins large-scale GR incl. context-parallel, and is referenced in NVIDIA RecSys examples.
