# DevOps CONTRIBUTIONS
###  1. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Long-Context Queries (32k paragraphs in query space)  + LLM (a. Falcon LLM local serving, and b. Openai API) + Semantic Search in Vector DB (Chroma) + End-to-end Deployed on GCP cloud platform
- https://github.com/TeleViaBox/society-llm-opinions-public


### 2. Neo4j + FastAPI + Prometheus + Grafana (Observability, Maintainability) + Load Test End-to-end Deployed on AWS cloud platform + Load Testing on AWS
- https://github.com/TeleViaBox/mini-neo4j-agent-backend
Website: Full-stack LLM conversational semantic search & chat using Vector Database with RAG
Cloud Deploy: Delivered a semantic search, chat app end-to-end (React UI, Python APIs), deployed on GCP with CI/CD.
Backend Maintainability, Scalability: Built an ANN Vector Database (Chroma) over 11 novels with sub-second retrieval; evaluated quality & performance (R@5/10 0.88/0.94, MRR@10 0.82; latency p50/p95 95/220 ms; QPS 14).

### Spotify Mega-scale system DevOps: Spotify/Pedalboard: Fixed #411.
- https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard/issues/411
- https://github.com/spotify/pedalboard/pull/432
[Method] Added 20-line PortAudio guard that raises RunTime Error when an output device vanishes,  
[Issue] eliminating an infinite-block bug that could 
[Impact] stall Spotify’s Safe-and-Sound pipelines (used to vet 7 M+ podcasts for 696 M MAU)

### Meta GPU DevOps: Meta-RecSys/Generative-Recommenders: Fixed #308. 
- https://github.com/meta-recsys/generative-recommenders/issues/308
- https://github.com/meta-recsys/generative-recommenders/pull/345
[Method] Added a gin-configurable HSTU attention backend dispatcher (auto: C++ on Hopper, else logs safe fallback). 
[Issue] Addresses the H100 efficiency / missing integration called out. 
[Impact] Enables Hopper installs to use the optimized attention path while preserving public pipelines; HSTU is reported deployed across multiple Meta surfaces serving billions of users, underpins Meta’s large-scale GR stack (incl. recent context-parallel training results), and is referenced by NVIDIA’s RecSys examples.

## Backend Stack

**External Interface (B2B / B2C Users)**
- **GraphQL API (HTTP):** Q&A requests, text uploads, job status queries, and result fetching from frontend/web.
- **GraphQL Subscriptions:** Real-time updates (job progress, streaming tokens).

**Internal Communication (between backend services)**
- **gRPC:** Fast, type-safe calls across embedding, retrieval, generation, classification services.
- **Event Bus (SNS→SQS or Kafka/Redpanda):** Async, decoupled workflows for indexing, streaming updates, long-job orchestration.

**Background Task Processing**
- **Celery** (recommended) or **RQ:** Long-running tasks like indexing, embedding generation, offline analysis, batch reporting.

**Persistent Storage & Dependencies**
- **Chroma / Vector DB:** Embedding storage for semantic retrieval (already in use).
- **Redis:** Task-queue broker (Celery/RQ), cache, and pub/sub for GraphQL subscriptions.
- **(Optional) PostgreSQL:** Tenants, billing, quotas, audit logs, job metadata.
- **Object Storage (S3 or equivalent):** Original files, intermediate artifacts, exported results.

## Recommendation System: A/B Test System Design

<details>
<summary><b>Business Scope</b> (Feb 2024)</summary>

**1) Metrics: Primary, Secondary, Guardrails**
- **Primary:** single main outcome; attributable, sensitive, stable.  
  *Examples:* daily engagement per user, average time spent, 7-day retention.  
- **Secondary:** aid understanding & side effects.  
  *Examples:* share rate, cold-start content views, creator diversity.  
- **Guardrails:** protect UX, performance, and business health.  
  *Examples:* latency (p95/p99), crash rate, content quality, policy violations, ad revenue.  
- **Rule:** Primary decides go/no-go; guardrails prevent “winning dirty.”

**2) Power & Sample Size**
- Use historical baselines + calculator/internal tooling.
- Reduce sample size via:
  - **Trigger-based sampling:** include only exposed/affected users.
  - **Variance reduction (CUPED):** pre-experiment behavior covariates.
  - **Clustering adjustment:** feeds aren’t IID → real sample needs may be higher.

**4) Feed-Specific Stats Considerations**
- **Design:** user-level randomization; trigger-based (only users who open feed); switchback tests for infra (alternate by time/geography).
- **Analysis:** aggregate at user-day; cluster-robust SEs; pre-bucket users; IPW/position correction at impression level.
- **Leakage control:** avoid splitting viral content/creators; for highly connected systems consider ghost experiments or community-level randomization.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Implementation Details</b> (Jan 2024)</summary>

**1) Trustworthiness: SRM, Stopping Rules, Multiplicity**
- **SRM:** chi-square check for expected control/treatment ratios; investigate routing/triggering if mismatched.
- **Stopping rules:** pre-register window & analysis; avoid peeking without correction; use alpha-spending or Bayesian approaches.
- **Multiple comparisons:** one primary metric; FDR (Benjamini–Hochberg) for secondaries/variants; bandits for exploration, confirm final rollout with traditional testing.

**2) Practical Execution Plan**
1. **Define goal & thresholds**  
   – e.g., “+1% lift in daily engagement,” MDE=+1%, α=0.05, power=0.8  
2. **Estimate sample size**  
   – historical data → triggered users per group  
3. **Randomization**  
   – user-level bucketing; include only triggered users; prevent creator/content leakage  
4. **Variance reduction**  
   – use previous 7-day behavior as covariates  
5. **Metrics & significance**  
   – aggregate at user-day; cluster-robust t-tests or regression  
6. **Health checks**  
   – SRM; latency/crash; guardrails (harmful content, complaints)  
7. **Interpretation & rollout**  
   – primary passed + guardrails stable; analyze heterogeneity; roll out / iterate / rollback; optional follow-up for long-term effects (e.g., 28-day retention)

## Open Source Contributions

### Recommendation Systems
- **Spotify/Pedalboard — Fixed #411**  
  *Method:* 20-line PortAudio guard that raises `RuntimeError` when an output device vanishes.  
  *Issue:* Eliminates an infinite-block bug that could stall Spotify’s Safe-and-Sound pipelines (used to vet 7M+ podcasts for 696M MAU).

- **Meta-RecSys/Generative-Recommenders — Fixed #308**  
  *Method:* Gin-configurable HSTU attention backend dispatcher (auto→C++ on Hopper; safe fallback otherwise) without changing defaults.  
  *Issue:* Addresses H100 efficiency / missing integration.  
  *Impact:* Hopper gets the optimized attention path without public-pipeline changes; HSTU underpins large-scale GR incl. context-parallel and appears in NVIDIA RecSys examples.
